  <b>Mathemati</b> is a website created with love by Cairo University's freshmen (graduating 2023) that features over <b>24 different numerical methods</b> that tackle different problems in mathematics, ranging from complicated problems like PDEs and ODEs that lack a closed form to other problems that you won't find elsewhere on the internet, such as Least Absolute Errors & Surface Interpolation, besides problems that can situationally get complicated such as non-linear systems and triple integrals. For the time being, you can visit the website at

Of course due to your internet, we'll get to Mars before you load the homepage, that's why the following is what we have for you instead

    <br>
You can navigate through different pages using your mouse or keyboard, the five general topics are <b> Curve Fitting, Surface Fitting, Calculus, Differential Equations and System of Equations. </b>    <br>
  </p>

    In order to find the method you want to use in O(1), it also comes with a <b>search feature.</b>

   True fans will be able to rediscover Mathemati in order to land on the <b> legacy homepage</b>, as a hint:

They also usually include a small document explaining how the method itself works/how it was implemented (the next icon down.)

    <b>Final note:</b> Please beware that some methods in the website demand that you use Python's syntax for mathematical expressions, not all methods support exponentiation through (a^b) insead of (a**b) and you should write (x*y) instead of (xy).
